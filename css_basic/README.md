# CSS Basic Setup - ALX HTML & CSS Project

This directory, `css_basic`, introduces basic styling to the previously created HTML pages using CSS.

## Structure

- `index.html`: Homepage from the `html_basic` project.
- `tweets.html`: Tweet sample page from the previous project.
- `base.css`: Predefined CSS file containing general layout and typography rules.
- `styles.css`: Empty CSS file to be filled with custom styles in future tasks.

## Changes Made

- Copied `index.html` and `tweets.html` from the `html_basic` directory.
- Created two CSS files: `base.css` (with base styles) and `styles.css` (currently empty).
- Linked both CSS files inside the `<head>` of each HTML file using:
  ```html
  <link href="base.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  ```

Used CSS Flexbox, a recent set of CSS properties that work with recent browsers to create layouts.
