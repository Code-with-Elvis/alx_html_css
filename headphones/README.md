# 🎧 Headphones Landing Page

A modern, responsive landing page built with **HTML and CSS** from the ground up. This project showcases my skills in creating pixel-perfect web designs with clean, maintainable code.

##  Project Overview

I developed this webpage to demonstrate my understanding of modern web development fundamentals. The design focuses on creating an engaging user experience with:

- Clean HTML5 semantic structure
- Modern CSS3 styling and animations
- Fully responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Accessibility best practices
- Interactive elements and smooth transitions

## 📁 Project Structure

All files are organized in:  
**`alx_html_css/headphones/`**

## Development Progress

I built this project incrementally, adding features step by step:

1. **Header/Hero Section** — Responsive navigation with hamburger menu and compelling hero content
2. **Services Section** — Showcasing what we do with custom icon integration
3. **Results Section** — Displaying key metrics with dynamic visual elements
4. **Contact Form** — User-friendly contact form with validation
5. **Footer** — Clean and professional page ending
6. **CSS Shapes** — Replaced images with pure CSS geometric shapes
7. **Animations** — Added smooth transitions and interactive effects
8. **Enhanced Navigation** — JavaScript-powered hamburger menu for mobile

## Responsive Design

- **Mobile breakpoint**: 480px and below
- **Maximum content width**: 1000px (centered)
- **Interactive states**:
  - Link hover/active: `#FF6565`
  - Button hover: `opacity: 0.9`

## 🎨 Design & Typography

I chose **Source Sans Pro** and **Spin Cycle OT** fonts to create a modern, professional look that enhances readability and visual appeal.

## ⚙️ Technical Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup
- **CSS3** - Styling, layout, and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Interactive functionality (final task)
- **No external dependencies** - Built entirely from scratch

## Learning Outcomes

This project represents my journey through the **HTML & CSS module**. I learned to translate design concepts into functional web pages, implement responsive layouts, and create engaging user experiences with clean, maintainable code.
